# TV Ratings Analysis – End-to-End Data Science Project

This project presents a complete end-to-end data science workflow to analyze TV channel ratings, viewer behavior, and show performance trends. The goal is to build a data-driven system that explores insights, preprocesses raw data, builds predictive models, and delivers meaningful conclusions for the media industry.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives
- Analyze viewership patterns and TV rating trends  
- Identify factors influencing audience engagement  
- Clean, transform, and explore raw ratings data  
- Build predictive models to estimate viewer ratings  
- Visualize insights and provide actionable recommendations  

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Machine Learning Models**
- **EDA & Feature Engineering**

## 📁 Dataset Description
The dataset typically includes:

- Channel Name  
- Program / Show Name  
- Genre  
- Telecast Date & Time  
- TRP / TV Ratings  
- Duration  
- Target Audience Category  
- Viewer Count  
- Region / Market  
- Demographic Breakdown (if available)  

---

## 🔧 Step 1: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handled missing values  
- Removed inconsistent records  
- Encoded categorical fields  
- Normalized viewer count and ratings  
- Date/Time formatting and time-based feature extraction  
- Outlier detection and treatment  

---

## 📊 Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Generated insights using:
- Channel-wise TRP comparison  
- Genre popularity  
- Prime-time vs non-prime-time analysis  
- Viewer trends by region  
- Top-performing shows  
- Heatmaps, bar charts, line charts, pair plots  

---

## 🧠 Step 3: Feature Engineering
- Extracted day, month, week, time-slot features  
- Created engagement metrics  
- Aggregated historical averages  
- Built rating trend indicators  

---

## 🤖 Step 4: Machine Learning Models
Built and compared multiple models:
- Linear Regression  
- Random Forest Regressor  
- XGBoost  
- Decision Tree  
- Gradient Boosting  

Evaluated using:
- MAE  
- RMSE  
- R² Score  

Best-performing model was chosen for final predictions.

## 🚀 Step 5: Final Prediction System
Created a model to predict TV ratings based on:
- Time-slot  
- Genre  
- Show type  
- Channel  
- Historical rating patterns  

---

## 📈 Step 6: Visualization & Insights
- Audience viewing spikes during prime time  
- Reality shows & sports dominate overall ratings  
- Certain genres perform better in regional markets  
- Ratings highly depend on day-of-week and time-of-day  
- Strong seasonal and festive variations observed
